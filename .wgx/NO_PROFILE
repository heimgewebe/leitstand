leitstand: NO WGX PROFILE (by design)

This repository is a dashboard / UI observer.
It consumes fleet outputs (chronik, semantAH insights, wgx metrics),
but it does not execute WGX motorik itself.

Rationale:
- Prevent semantic confusion: a motorik profile suggests guard/smoke/render responsibilities.
- Keep fleet coherence: presence of this marker is an explicit, reviewable exception.

If leitstand ever becomes an executor repo, remove this file and add .wgx/profile.yml.
